		<p>These are 3''x3'' images of one of our objects in different NIRCam and MIRI filters. Left-most panel shows the image in NIRCam/F277W filter whose 80% enclosed point source energy radius (0.179'') is used as the aperture size to measure the central flux which forms the red points in the Figure 2 of the poster. This aperture was fixed for all filters and is shown by red circle in each image. The black dotted line in the left-most panel gives the Kron radius for this source used by CANDELS to measure the source flux reported in their catalogues that forms our the black points in the Figure 2 of the poster. The black star shows the co-ordinates of the optical counterpart given by AEGIS-X. The corrected centres in IR are shown by red star in the left-most panel.</p>

		<summary>What do your galaxy properties look like? (bonus: more AGN parameters!)</summary>
		<img src="assets/img/dg2024/population_histogram.png" width="800px">
		<p>The population level distribution of selected stellar population parameters (blue boxes), AGN parameters (red boxes), and galaxy dust heated by star formation parameters (green boxes). The colour of the box corresponds to the colour of lines in Figure 2.</p>
